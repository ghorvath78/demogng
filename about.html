<h1>About DemoGNG.js</h1>

<p>
What is this site for?

<ul>
<li> illustrating (e.g. to students or researchers) the principles of a group of 
computational models which all rely on vectors 
to characterize an underlying data set or continuous probability distribution. 
Applications of such models are in data compression,
 clustering, function approximation and more. The models can be seen as belonging to the "Big Data" domain.
<li> provide a successor for the previous DemoGNG simulator which was
 realized in 1995 by Hartmut Loos under my 
supervision. Since this simulator was realized as a
 Java applet it can not be reasonably used any more due to decreasing or lacking applet support in the major browsers.
A link to the page for the DemoGNG applet can be found <a href="http://www.demogng.de/javademogng.html">here</a>
<li> Having fun!  Experimenting with the network models can produce nice images and 
interesting animations. Luckily JavaScript has become quite fast and supports reasonable frame rates. 
Try out the simple touch interface if you have a supporting device (tablet, smartphone or PC touchscreen). 
Just touch the middle of the canvas shortly for instructions.

Some packages were particularily helpful in realizing this simulator:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.raymondhill.net/voronoi/rhill-voronoi.html"> Raymond Hill's implementation of Steven J. Fortune's algorithm to compute Voronoi diagrams</a>
<li> The following two jQuery Foundation Projects<br>
